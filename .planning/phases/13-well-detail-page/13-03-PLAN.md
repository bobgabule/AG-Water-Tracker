<objective>
Verify the complete well detail page flow end-to-end with human visual inspection.

Purpose: Confirm the sheet looks and behaves correctly on a real device/browser before marking the phase complete.
Output: Human-verified well detail page

  <name>Task 1: Visual verification of complete well detail page</name>
  <files></files>
  <action>
Human visual verification of the complete well detail page implementation.

What was built: Complete well detail page with slide-up sheet, header with well metadata and status indicators, usage gauge, readings history with user names and GPS indicators, swipe gestures (dismiss + well navigation), and empty states.

Steps to verify:
1. Start the dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Log in and navigate to the map (dashboard)
3. **Tap a well marker** on the map
   - Verify: A sheet slides up from the bottom covering ~90% of the viewport
   - Verify: Dark semi-transparent scrim visible behind the sheet
   - Verify: Smooth animation (~350ms)
4. **Check the header** (pinned at top):
   - Verify: Farm name displayed (small text, centered)
   - Verify: Well name displayed (large, bold)
   - Verify: Serial number, WMIS number, and "Last Updated" date shown
   - Verify: Pump, Battery, and Meter status indicator chips with colored icons
5. **Check the content** (scrollable area):
   - If well has allocations: Verify usage gauge bar shows allocated/used/remaining
   - If well has no allocations: Verify "No allocation set" message
   - If well has readings: Verify readings list shows date, value, user name, time
   - If well has no readings: Verify "No readings yet" message
   - If GPS available: Verify "In Range" or "Out of Range" indicator with distance
6. **Test back button** (top-left arrow):
   - Verify: Tapping back dismisses the sheet and returns to the map
7. **Test edit button** (top-right pencil icon):
   - Verify: Tapping edit navigates to `/wells/:id/edit` (may show 404 -- that's fine, edit form is a future phase)
8. **Test swipe-down** on the header area:
   - Verify: Swiping down dismisses the sheet
9. **Test overlay tap**:
   - Verify: Tapping the dark overlay does NOT dismiss the sheet
10. **Test well-to-well navigation** (if multiple wells exist):
    - Swipe left on the header: should transition to the next nearest well with a brief fade
    - Swipe right on the header: should transition to the previous well
    - Verify: The well name and all data change to reflect the new well
11. **Test scrolling** the readings list:
    - Verify: Can scroll through readings without accidentally dismissing the sheet
